/**
 * A client to Stackdriver Monitoring API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>================== GroupServiceClient ==================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: The Group API lets you inspect and manage your
 * [groups](google.monitoring.v3.Group).
 *
 * <p>A group is a named filter that is used to identify a collection of monitored resources. Groups
 * are typically used to mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment. Because
 * group membership is computed dynamically, monitored resources that are started in the future are
 * automatically placed in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in, for
 * example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is updated automatically as monitored
 * resources are added and removed from the infrastructure.
 *
 * <p>Sample for GroupServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (GroupServiceClient groupServiceClient = GroupServiceClient.create()) {
 *   GroupName name = GroupName.of("[PROJECT]", "[GROUP]");
 *   Group response = groupServiceClient.getGroup(name);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * =================== MetricServiceClient ===================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Manages metric descriptors, monitored resource descriptors, and time
 * series data.
 *
 * <p>Sample for MetricServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (MetricServiceClient metricServiceClient = MetricServiceClient.create()) {
 *   MonitoredResourceDescriptorName name = MonitoredResourceDescriptorName.of("[PROJECT]", "[MONITORED_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR]");
 *   MonitoredResourceDescriptor response = metricServiceClient.getMonitoredResourceDescriptor(name);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
