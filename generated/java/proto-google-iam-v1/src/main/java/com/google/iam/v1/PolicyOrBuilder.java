   * conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
   * systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
   * ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
   * If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then the existing
   * policy is overwritten. Due to blind-set semantics of an etag-less policy,
   * 'setIamPolicy' will not fail even if either of incoming or stored policy
   * does not meet the version requirements.
