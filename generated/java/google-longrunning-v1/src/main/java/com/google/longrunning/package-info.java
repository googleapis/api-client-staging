/**
 * A client to Google Long Running Operations API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>============= OperationsApi =============
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Manages long-running operations with an API service.
 *
 * <p>When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed to return
 * [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this interface to
 * receive the real response asynchronously by polling the operation resource, or pass the operation
 * resource to another API (such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response. Any API
 * service that returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface so
 * developers can have a consistent client experience.
