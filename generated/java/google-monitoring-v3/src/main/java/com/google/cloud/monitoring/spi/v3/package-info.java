/**
 * A client to Stackdriver Monitoring API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with a usage sample
 *
 * <p>=============== GroupServiceApi ===============
 *
 * <p>Service Description: The Group API lets you inspect and manage your
 * [groups](google.monitoring.v3.Group).
 *
 * <p>A group is a named filter that is used to identify a collection of monitored resources. Groups
 * are typically used to mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment. Because
 * group membership is computed dynamically, monitored resources that are started in the future are
 * automatically placed in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in, for
 * example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is updated automatically as monitored
 * resources are added and removed from the infrastructure.
 *
 * <p>Sample for GroupServiceApi:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (GroupServiceApi groupServiceApi = GroupServiceApi.create()) {
 *   String formattedName = GroupServiceApi.formatGroupName("[PROJECT]", "[GROUP]");
 *   Group response = groupServiceApi.getGroup(formattedName);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * ================ MetricServiceApi ================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Manages metric descriptors, monitored resource descriptors, and time
 * series data.
 *
 * <p>Sample for MetricServiceApi:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (MetricServiceApi metricServiceApi = MetricServiceApi.create()) {
 *   String formattedName = MetricServiceApi.formatMonitoredResourceDescriptorName("[PROJECT]", "[MONITORED_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR]");
 *   MonitoredResourceDescriptor response = metricServiceApi.getMonitoredResourceDescriptor(formattedName);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
