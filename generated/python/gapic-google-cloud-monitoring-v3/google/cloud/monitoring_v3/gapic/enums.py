        """
        The Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single
        time series into temporal alignment.

        Attributes:
          ALIGN_NONE (int): No alignment. Raw data is returned. Not valid if cross-time
          series reduction is requested. The value type of the result is
          the same as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_DELTA (int): Align and convert to delta metric type. This alignment is valid
          for cumulative metrics and delta metrics. Aligning an existing
          delta metric to a delta metric requires that the alignment
          period be increased. The value type of the result is the same
          as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_RATE (int): Align and convert to a rate. This alignment is valid for
          cumulative metrics and delta metrics with numeric values. The output is a
          gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_INTERPOLATE (int): Align by interpolating between adjacent points around the
          period boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
          metrics with numeric values. The value type of the result is the same
          as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_NEXT_OLDER (int): Align by shifting the oldest data point before the period
          boundary to the boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
          metrics. The value type of the result is the same as the
          value type of the input.
          ALIGN_MIN (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the minimum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          values. The value type of the result is the same as the value
          type of the input.
          ALIGN_MAX (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the maximum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          values. The value type of the result is the same as the value
          type of the input.
          ALIGN_MEAN (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the average or arithmetic mean of all
          data points in the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta
          metrics with numeric values. The value type of the output is
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_COUNT (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the count of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          or Boolean values. The value type of the output is
          ``INT64``.
          ALIGN_SUM (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the sum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          and distribution values. The value type of the output is the
          same as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_STDDEV (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the standard deviation of all data
          points in the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics
          with numeric values. The value type of the output is
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_COUNT_TRUE (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the count of True-valued data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge metrics with
          Boolean values. The value type of the output is
          ``INT64``.
          ALIGN_FRACTION_TRUE (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the fraction of True-valued data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge metrics with Boolean values.
          The output value is in the range [0, 1] and has value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_99 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the 99th percentile of all data
          points in the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics
          with distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_95 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the 95th percentile of all data
          points in the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics
          with distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_50 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the 50th percentile of all data
          points in the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics
          with distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
