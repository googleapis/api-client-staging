/**
 * Service Description: Service that performs Google Cloud Vision API detection tasks over client
 * images, such as face, landmark, logo, label, and text detection. The
 * ImageAnnotator service returns detected entities from the images.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: This client library class has not yet been declared GA (1.0). This means that
 * even though we intend the surface to be stable, we may make backwards incompatible changes
 * if necessary.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * ```
 * $imageAnnotatorClient = new ImageAnnotatorClient();
 * try {
 *     $requests = [];
 *     $response = $imageAnnotatorClient->batchAnnotateImages($requests);
 * } finally {
 *     $imageAnnotatorClient->close();
 * }
 * ```

     *           The address of the API remote host. May optionally include the port, formatted
     *           as "<uri>:<port>". Default 'vision.googleapis.com:443'.
     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials
     *           The credentials to be used by the client to authorize API calls. This option
     *           accepts either a path to a credentials file, or a decoded credentials file as a
     *           PHP array.
     *           *Advanced usage*: In addition, this option can also accept a pre-constructed

     *     @type string|array $clientConfig
     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either a
     *           path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data.
     *           By default this settings points to the default client config file, which is provided
     *           in the resources folder.
     *     @type string|TransportInterface $transport
     *           The transport used for executing network requests. May be either the string `rest`
     *           or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already instantiated

     *           Configuration options that will be used to construct the transport. Options for
     *           each supported transport type should be passed in a key for that transport. For
