  module Logging
    module V2
      # Describes a logs-based metric.  The value of the metric is the
      # number of log entries that match a logs filter in a given time interval.
      # @!attribute [rw] name
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. The client-assigned metric identifier.
      #     Examples: +"error_count"+, +"nginx/requests"+.
      #
      #     Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include
      #     only the following characters: +A-Z+, +a-z+, +0-9+, and the
      #     special characters +_-.,+!*',()%/+.  The forward-slash character
      #     (+/+) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the
      #     first character of the name.
      #
      #     The metric identifier in this field must not be
      #     [URL-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
      #     However, when the metric identifier appears as the +[METRIC_ID]+
      #     part of a +metric_name+ API parameter, then the metric identifier
      #     must be URL-encoded. Example:
      #     +"projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests"+.
      # @!attribute [rw] description
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in documentation.
      # @!attribute [rw] filter
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. An [advanced logs filter](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters)
      #     which is used to match log entries.
      #     Example:
      #
      #         "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR"
      #
      #     The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
      # @!attribute [rw] version
      #   @return [Google::Logging::V2::LogMetric::ApiVersion]
      #     Output only. The API version that created or updated this metric.
      #     The version also dictates the syntax of the filter expression. When a value
      #     for this field is missing, the default value of V2 should be assumed.
      class LogMetric
        # Stackdriver Logging API version.

      #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
      # @!attribute [rw] page_token
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
      #     preceding call to this method.  +pageToken+ must be the value of
      #     +nextPageToken+ from the previous response.  The values of other method
      #     parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
      # @!attribute [rw] page_size
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
      #     Non-positive values are ignored.  The presence of +nextPageToken+ in the
      #     response indicates that more results might be available.
