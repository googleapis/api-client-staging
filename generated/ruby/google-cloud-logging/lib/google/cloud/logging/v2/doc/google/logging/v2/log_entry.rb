module Google
  module Logging
    module V2
      # An individual entry in a log.
      # @!attribute [rw] log_name
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. The resource name of the log to which this log entry belongs:
      #
      #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #
      #     +[LOG_ID]+ must be URL-encoded within +log_name+. Example:
      #     +"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"+.
      #     +[LOG_ID]+ must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the
      #     following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters,
      #     forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.
      #
      #     For backward compatibility, if +log_name+ begins with a forward-slash, such
      #     as +/projects/...+, then the log entry is ingested as usual but the
      #     forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading
      #     slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return
      #     any results.
      # @!attribute [rw] resource
      #   @return [Google::Api::MonitoredResource]
      #     Required. The monitored resource associated with this log entry.
      #     Example: a log entry that reports a database error would be
      #     associated with the monitored resource designating the particular
      #     database that reported the error.
      # @!attribute [rw] proto_payload
      #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Any]
      #     The log entry payload, represented as a protocol buffer.  Some
      #     Google Cloud Platform services use this field for their log
      #     entry payloads.
      # @!attribute [rw] text_payload
      #   @return [String]
      #     The log entry payload, represented as a Unicode string (UTF-8).
      # @!attribute [rw] json_payload
      #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Struct]
      #     The log entry payload, represented as a structure that is
      #     expressed as a JSON object.
      # @!attribute [rw] timestamp
      #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
      #     Optional. The time the event described by the log entry occurred.  If
      #     omitted in a new log entry, Stackdriver Logging will insert the time the
      #     log entry is received.  Stackdriver Logging might reject log entries whose
      #     time stamps are more than a couple of hours in the future. Log entries
      #     with time stamps in the past are accepted.
      # @!attribute [rw] receive_timestamp
      #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
      #     Output only. The time the log entry was received by Stackdriver Logging.
      # @!attribute [rw] severity
      #   @return [Google::Logging::Type::LogSeverity]
      #     Optional. The severity of the log entry. The default value is
      #     +LogSeverity.DEFAULT+.
      # @!attribute [rw] insert_id
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. A unique identifier for the log entry. If you provide a value,
      #     then Stackdriver Logging considers other log entries in the same project,
      #     with the same +timestamp+, and with the same +insert_id+ to be duplicates
      #     which can be removed.  If omitted in new log entries, then Stackdriver
      #     Logging will insert its own unique identifier. The +insert_id+ is used
      #     to order log entries that have the same +timestamp+ value.
      # @!attribute [rw] http_request
      #   @return [Google::Logging::Type::HttpRequest]
      #     Optional. Information about the HTTP request associated with this
      #     log entry, if applicable.
      # @!attribute [rw] labels
      #   @return [Hash{String => String}]
      #     Optional. A set of user-defined (key, value) data that provides additional
      #     information about the log entry.
      # @!attribute [rw] operation
      #   @return [Google::Logging::V2::LogEntryOperation]
      #     Optional. Information about an operation associated with the log entry, if
      #     applicable.
      # @!attribute [rw] trace
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. Resource name of the trace associated with the log entry, if any.
      #     If it contains a relative resource name, the name is assumed to be relative
      #     to +//tracing.googleapis.com+. Example:
      #     +projects/my-projectid/traces/06796866738c859f2f19b7cfb3214824+
      # @!attribute [rw] source_location
      #   @return [Google::Logging::V2::LogEntrySourceLocation]
      #     Optional. Source code location information associated with the log entry,
      #     if any.
      class LogEntry; end

      # Additional information about a potentially long-running operation with which
      # a log entry is associated.
      # @!attribute [rw] id
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. An arbitrary operation identifier. Log entries with the
      #     same identifier are assumed to be part of the same operation.
      # @!attribute [rw] producer
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. An arbitrary producer identifier. The combination of
      #     +id+ and +producer+ must be globally unique.  Examples for +producer+:
      #     +"MyDivision.MyBigCompany.com"+, +"github.com/MyProject/MyApplication"+.
      # @!attribute [rw] first
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Optional. Set this to True if this is the first log entry in the operation.
      # @!attribute [rw] last
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Optional. Set this to True if this is the last log entry in the operation.
      class LogEntryOperation; end

      # Additional information about the source code location that produced the log
      # entry.
      # @!attribute [rw] file
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. Source file name. Depending on the runtime environment, this
      #     might be a simple name or a fully-qualified name.
      # @!attribute [rw] line
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     Optional. Line within the source file. 1-based; 0 indicates no line number
      #     available.
      # @!attribute [rw] function
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. Human-readable name of the function or method being invoked, with
      #     optional context such as the class or package name. This information may be
      #     used in contexts such as the logs viewer, where a file and line number are
      #     less meaningful. The format can vary by language. For example:
      #     +qual.if.ied.Class.method+ (Java), +dir/package.func+ (Go), +function+
      #     (Python).
      class LogEntrySourceLocation; end
