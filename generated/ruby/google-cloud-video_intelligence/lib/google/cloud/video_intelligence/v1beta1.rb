        # Service that implements Google Cloud Video Intelligence API.
        #
        # @param service_path [String]
        #   The domain name of the API remote host.
        # @param port [Integer]
        #   The port on which to connect to the remote host.
        # @param credentials
        #   [Google::Gax::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
        #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
        #   be many types.
        #   A `Google::Gax::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
        #   authenticating requests made by this client.
        #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
        #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
        #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
        #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
        # @param scopes [Array<String>]
        #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
        #   an updater_proc is supplied.
        # @param client_config[Hash]
        #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
        #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
        #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
        #   or the specified config is missing data points.
        # @param timeout [Numeric]
        #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
