        # The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a collection of
        # debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These agents are each attached
        # to a process of an application which may include one or more replicas.
        #
        # The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the application
        # being debugged, the Debuggee. All agents that register with the same data,
        # represent the same Debuggee, and are assigned the same +debuggee_id+.
        #
        # The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve  the list of active
        # Breakpoints. Agents with the same +debuggee_id+ get the same breakpoints
        # list. An agent that can fulfill the breakpoint request updates the
        # Controller with the breakpoint result. The controller selects the first
        # result received and discards the rest of the results.
        # Agents that poll again for active breakpoints will no longer have
        # the completed breakpoint in the list and should remove that breakpoint from
        # their attached process.
        #
        # The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the results of
        # a completed breakpoint. This functionality is available using the Debugger
        # service.
