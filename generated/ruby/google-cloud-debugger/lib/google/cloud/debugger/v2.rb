    # without stopping or slowing it down.
    #
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Stackdriver Debugger API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/debugger)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-debugger
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Stackdriver Debugger API Product documentation][Product Documentation] to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md) to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

          ##
          # The Debugger service provides the API that allows users to collect run-time
          # information from a running application, without stopping or slowing it down
          # and without modifying its state.  An application may include one or
          # more replicated processes performing the same work.
          #
          # A debugged application is represented using the Debuggee concept. The
          # Debugger service provides a way to query for available debuggees, but does
          # not provide a way to create one.  A debuggee is created using the Controller
          # service, usually by running a debugger agent with the application.
          #
          # The Debugger service enables the client to set one or more Breakpoints on a
          # Debuggee and collect the results of the set Breakpoints.
          #
          # @param service_path [String]
          #   The domain name of the API remote host.
          # @param port [Integer]
          #   The port on which to connect to the remote host.
          # @param credentials
          #   [Google::Gax::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
          #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
          #   be many types.
          #   A `Google::Gax::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
          #   authenticating requests made by this client.
          #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
          #   credentials for this client.
          #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
          #   credentials for this client.
          #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
          #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
          #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
          #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
          #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
          # @param scopes [Array<String>]
          #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
          #   an updater_proc is supplied.
          # @param client_config[Hash]
          #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
          #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
          #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
          #   or the specified config is missing data points.
          # @param timeout [Numeric]
          #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.

          ##
          # The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a collection of
          # debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These agents are each attached
          # to a process of an application which may include one or more replicas.
          #
          # The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the application
          # being debugged, the Debuggee. All agents that register with the same data,
          # represent the same Debuggee, and are assigned the same +debuggee_id+.
          #
          # The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve  the list of active
          # Breakpoints. Agents with the same +debuggee_id+ get the same breakpoints
          # list. An agent that can fulfill the breakpoint request updates the
          # Controller with the breakpoint result. The controller selects the first
          # result received and discards the rest of the results.
          # Agents that poll again for active breakpoints will no longer have
          # the completed breakpoint in the list and should remove that breakpoint from
          # their attached process.
          #
          # The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the results of
          # a completed breakpoint. This functionality is available using the Debugger
          # service.
