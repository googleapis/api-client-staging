      # @!attribute [rw] interval
      #   @return [Google::Monitoring::V3::TimeInterval]
      #     The time interval to which the data point applies.  For GAUGE metrics, only
      #     the end time of the interval is used.  For DELTA metrics, the start and end
      #     time should specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying
      #     contiguous and non-overlapping intervals.  For CUMULATIVE metrics, the
      #     start and end time should specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent
      #     points specifying the same start time and increasing end times, until an
      #     event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the
      #     following points.
      # @!attribute [rw] value
      #   @return [Google::Monitoring::V3::TypedValue]
      #     The value of the data point.

      # A collection of data points that describes the time-varying values
      # of a metric. A time series is identified by a combination of a
      # fully-specified monitored resource and a fully-specified metric.
      # This type is used for both listing and creating time series.
      # @!attribute [rw] metric
      #   @return [Google::Api::Metric]
      #     The associated metric. A fully-specified metric used to identify the time
      #     series.
      # @!attribute [rw] resource
      #   @return [Google::Api::MonitoredResource]
      #     The associated resource. A fully-specified monitored resource used to
      #     identify the time series.
      # @!attribute [rw] metric_kind
      #   @return [Google::Api::MetricDescriptor::MetricKind]
      #     The metric kind of the time series. When listing time series, this metric
      #     kind might be different from the metric kind of the associated metric if
      #     this time series is an alignment or reduction of other time series.
      #
      #     When creating a time series, this field is optional. If present, it must be
      #     the same as the metric kind of the associated metric. If the associated
      #     metric's descriptor must be auto-created, then this field specifies the
      #     metric kind of the new descriptor and must be either +GAUGE+ (the default)
      #     or +CUMULATIVE+.
      # @!attribute [rw] value_type
      #   @return [Google::Api::MetricDescriptor::ValueType]
      #     The value type of the time series. When listing time series, this value
      #     type might be different from the value type of the associated metric if
      #     this time series is an alignment or reduction of other time series.
      #
      #     When creating a time series, this field is optional. If present, it must be
      #     the same as the type of the data in the +points+ field.
      # @!attribute [rw] points
      #   @return [Array<Google::Monitoring::V3::Point>]
      #     The data points of this time series. When listing time series, the order of
      #     the points is specified by the list method.
      #
      #     When creating a time series, this field must contain exactly one point and
      #     the point's type must be the same as the value type of the associated
      #     metric. If the associated metric's descriptor must be auto-created, then
      #     the value type of the descriptor is determined by the point's type, which
      #     must be +BOOL+, +INT64+, +DOUBLE+, or +DISTRIBUTION+.
