    # # Ruby Client for Stackdriver Monitoring API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Stackdriver Monitoring API][Product Documentation]: Manages your Stackdriver Monitoring data and configurations. Most projects must be associated with a Stackdriver account, with a few exceptions as noted on the individual method pages.
    #
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Stackdriver Monitoring API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-monitoring
    # ```
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### MetricServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/monitoring"
    #
    # metric_service_client = Google::Cloud::Monitoring::Metric.new
    # formatted_name = Google::Cloud::Monitoring::V3::MetricServiceClient.project_path(project_id)
    #
    # # Iterate over all results.
    # metric_service_client.list_monitored_resource_descriptors(formatted_name).each do |element|
    #   # Process element.
    # end
    #
    # # Or iterate over results one page at a time.
    # metric_service_client.list_monitored_resource_descriptors(formatted_name).each_page do |page|
    #   # Process each page at a time.
    #   page.each do |element|
    #     # Process element.
    #   end
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Stackdriver Monitoring API Product documentation][Product Documentation] to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md) to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

        # The Group API lets you inspect and manage your
        # [groups](https://cloud.google.comgoogle.monitoring.v3.Group).
        #
        # A group is a named filter that is used to identify
        # a collection of monitored resources. Groups are typically used to
        # mirror the physical and/or logical topology of the environment.
        # Because group membership is computed dynamically, monitored
        # resources that are started in the future are automatically placed
        # in matching groups. By using a group to name monitored resources in,
        # for example, an alert policy, the target of that alert policy is
        # updated automatically as monitored resources are added and removed
        # from the infrastructure.
