          # The Debugger service provides the API that allows users to collect run-time
          # information from a running application, without stopping or slowing it down
          # and without modifying its state.  An application may include one or
          # more replicated processes performing the same work.
          #
          # The application is represented using the Debuggee concept. The Debugger
          # service provides a way to query for available Debuggees, but does not
          # provide a way to create one.  A debuggee is created using the Controller
          # service, usually by running a debugger agent with the application.

          # Debuggee and collect the results of the set Breakpoints.
