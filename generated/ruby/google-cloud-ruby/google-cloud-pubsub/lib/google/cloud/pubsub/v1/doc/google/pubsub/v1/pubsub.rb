      #     The currently supported attribute is +x-goog-version+, which you can
      #     use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute
      #     indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This
      #     controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).
      #     The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
      #
      #     If not present during the +CreateSubscription+ call, it will default to
      #     the version of the API used to make such call. If not present during a

      #     calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was
