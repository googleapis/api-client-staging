    # # Ruby Client for DLP API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [DLP API][Product Documentation]: The Google Data Loss Prevention API provides methods for detection of privacy-sensitive fragments in text, images, and Google Cloud Platform storage repositories.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the DLP API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/dlp)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-dlp
    # ```
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### DlpServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/dlp"
    #
    # dlp_service_client = Google::Cloud::Dlp.new
    # min_likelihood = :POSSIBLE
    # inspect_config = { min_likelihood: min_likelihood }
    # type = "text/plain"
    # value = "my phone number is 215-512-1212"
    # items_element = { type: type, value: value }
    # items = [items_element]
    # response = dlp_service_client.inspect_content(inspect_config, items)
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [DLP API Product documentation][Product Documentation] to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md) to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

      AVAILABLE_VERSIONS = Dir["#{FILE_DIR}/*"]
        .select {|file| File.directory?(file)}
        .select {|dir| Google::Gax::VERSION_MATCHER.match(File.basename(dir))}

      ##
      # The DLP API is a service that allows clients
      # to detect the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other
      # privacy-sensitive data in user-supplied, unstructured data streams, like text
      # blocks or images.
      # The service also includes methods for sensitive data redaction and
      # scheduling of data scans on Google Cloud Platform based data sets.
      #
      # @param version [Symbol, String]
      #   The major version of the service to be used. By default :v2beta1
      #   is used.
      # @param service_path [String]
      #   The domain name of the API remote host.
      # @param port [Integer]
      #   The port on which to connect to the remote host.
      # @param credentials
      #   [Google::Gax::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
      #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
      #   be many types.
      #   A `Google::Gax::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #   authenticating requests made by this client.
      #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
      #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
      #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      # @param scopes [Array<String>]
      #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
      #   an updater_proc is supplied.
      # @param client_config[Hash]
      #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
      #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
      #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
      #   or the specified config is missing data points.
      # @param timeout [Numeric]
      #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
