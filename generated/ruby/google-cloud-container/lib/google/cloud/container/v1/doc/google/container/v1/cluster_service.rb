      #   @return [String]
      #     The name of a Google Compute Engine [machine
      #     type](/compute/docs/machine-types) (e.g.
      #     +n1-standard-1+).
      #
      #     If unspecified, the default machine type is
      #     +n1-standard-1+.
      # @!attribute [rw] disk_size_gb
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB.
      #     The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB.

      # @!attribute [rw] oauth_scopes
      #   @return [Array<String>]
      #     The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the
      #     node VMs under the "default" service account.
      #
      #     The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by default are
      #     not included:
      #
      #     * +https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute+ is required for mounting
      #       persistent storage on your nodes.
      #     * +https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only+ is required for
      #       communicating with **gcr.io**
      #       (the [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)).
      #
      #     If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud
      #     Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will be added.
      # @!attribute [rw] service_account
      #   @return [String]
      #     The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node VMs. If
      #     no Service Account is specified, the "default" service account is used.
      # @!attribute [rw] metadata
      #   @return [Hash{String => String}]
      #     The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster.
      #
      #     Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than 128 bytes
      #     in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server.
      #     Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other
      #     metadata keys for the project or be one of the four reserved keys:
      #     "instance-template", "kube-env", "startup-script", and "user-data"
      #
      #     Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by
      #     the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on them is
      #     that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32 KB.
      #
      #     The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.
      # @!attribute [rw] image_type
      #   @return [String]
      #     The image type to use for this node. Note that for a given image type,
      #     the latest version of it will be used.
      # @!attribute [rw] labels
      #   @return [Hash{String => String}]
      #     The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to each node.
      #     These will added in addition to any default label(s) that
      #     Kubernetes may apply to the node.
      #     In case of conflict in label keys, the applied set may differ depending on
      #     the Kubernetes version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined
      #     and conflicts should be avoided.
      #     For more information, including usage and the valid values, see:
      #     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
      # @!attribute [rw] local_ssd_count
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     The number of local SSD disks to be attached to the node.
      #
      #     The limit for this value is dependant upon the maximum number of
      #     disks available on a machine per zone. See:
      #     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#local_ssd_limits
      #     for more information.
      # @!attribute [rw] tags
      #   @return [Array<String>]
      #     The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to identify
      #     valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by

      #     must comply with RFC1035.
      # @!attribute [rw] preemptible
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Whether the nodes are created as preemptible VM instances. See:
      #     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible for more
      #     information about preemptible VM instances.
      # @!attribute [rw] accelerators
      #   @return [Array<Google::Container::V1::AcceleratorConfig>]
      #     A list of hardware accelerators to be attached to each node.
      #     See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus for more information about
      #     support for GPUs.
      # @!attribute [rw] min_cpu_platform
      #   @return [String]
