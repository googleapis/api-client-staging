    # # Ruby Client for Google Container Engine API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Google Container Engine API][Product Documentation]:
    # The Google Kubernetes Engine API is used for building and managing container
    # based applications, powered by the open source Kubernetes technology.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
    # steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Google Container Engine API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/container)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Google Container Engine API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
    #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
    #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

        # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
        #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
        #   be many types.
        #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
        #   authenticating requests made by this client.
        #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
        #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
        #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
        #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
        # @param scopes [Array<String>]
        #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
        #   an updater_proc is supplied.
        # @param client_config [Hash]
        #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
        #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
        #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
        #   or the specified config is missing data points.
        # @param timeout [Numeric]
        #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
