          #     deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of
          #     resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
          #     And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
          #     firewall, load balancing, etc.).
          #
          #     * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
          #       the following regular expression: +[a-z](https://cloud.google.com[-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?+.
          #     * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform

          #     See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
          #
          #     If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
          #     characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an
          #     internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
          #     specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
          #     as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
